Stimulant laxative products should not be used when abdominal pain, nausea, or vomiting are present. Rectal bleeding or failure to have a bowel movement within 24 hours after use of a laxative may indicate a serious condition. Chronic use may cause dependence and need for increased dosages, disturbances of water and electro- lyte balance (e.g. hypokalaemia), and an atonic colon with impaired function (28).
The use of stimulant laxatives for more than 2 weeks requires medical supervision.
Chronic abuse with diarrhoea and consequent fluid and electrolyte losses (mainly hypokalaemia) may cause albuminuria and haematuria, and may result in cardiac and neuromuscular dysfunction, the latter particularly in the case of concomitant use of cardiac glycosides (digoxin), diuretics, corticosteroids, or liquorice root (see Precautions below","Abdominal spasms and pain may occur after even a single dose. Overdose can lead to colicky abdominal spasms and pain, as well as the formation of thin, watery stools (28).
Chronic abuse of anthraquinone stimulant laxatives can lead to hepatitis (41). Long-term laxative abuse may lead to electrolyte disturbances (hypokalaemia, hypocalcaemia), metabolic acidosis, malabsorption, weight loss, albuminuria, and haematuria (30, 42, 43). Weakness and orthostatic hypotension may be exacerbated in elderly patients when stimulant laxatives are repeatedly used (31). Secondary aldosteronism may occur owing to renal tubular damage after aggravated use. Steatorrhoea and protein-losing gastroenteropathy with hypoalbuminaemia have also been observed, as have excessive excretion of calcium in the stools and osteomalacia of the vertebral column (44, 45). Melanotic pigmentation of the colonic mucosa (pseudo- melanosis coli) has been observed in individuals taking anthraquinone laxatives for extended time periods (29, 42). The pigmentation is clinically harmless and usually reversible within 4 to 12 months after the drug is discontinued (29, 42). Conflicting data exist on other toxic effects such as intestinal-neuronal damage after long-term use","The correct individual dose is the smallest amount required to produce a soft-formed stool (26).

Aloe Vera Gel is widely used for the external treatment of minor wounds and inflammatory skin disorders (1, 14?17). The gel is used in the treatment of minor skin irritations, including burns, bruises, and abrasions (1, 14, 18). The gel is further used in the cosmetics industry as a hydrating ingredient in liquids, creams, sun lotions, shaving creams, lip balms, healing ointments, and face packs (1).
Aloe Vera Gel has been traditionally used as a natural remedy for burns (18, 19). Aloe Vera Gel has been effectively used in the treatment of first- and second-degree thermal burns and radiation burns. Both thermal and radiation burns healed faster with less necrosis when treated with preparations contain- ing Aloe Vera Gel (18, 19). In most cases the gel must be freshly prepared because of its sensitivity to enzymatic, oxidative, or microbial degradation. Aloe Vera Gel is not approved as an internal medication, and internal adminis- tration of the gel has not been shown to exert any consistent therapeutic effect",No information available.,"There have been a few reports of contact dermatitis and burning skin sensations following topical applications of Aloe Vera Gel to dermabraded skin (18, 32). These reactions appeared to be associated with anthraquinone contaminants in this preparation (33). A case of disseminated dermatitis has been reported following application of Aloe Vera Gel to a patient with stasis dermatitis (34). An acute bullous allergic reaction and contact urticaria have also been reported to result from the use of Aloe Vera Gel ",Fresh gel or preparations containing 10?70% fresh gel.,
